# Time-Series-Prediction
This repository helps in performing time series prediction on Road Dataset of nearly 25Kms

# Objective-
The objective was to predict values of Para 9-13 for the 10th year of each section. I used an extra-trees regressor model by taking Para 1-8 and year as inputs in each section to perform regression upon this dataset.

# Methodology Used-
Transformed the Data into Train and Test Dataset, by extracting 10th year data for para 9-13 for every section. Applied Extra Regressor Model to implent random forest and predicted the values
